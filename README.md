# Team426Robot
Code base for ZACTF 2020

## FRC - First Robotics Competition
Documentation of FRC at SSIS in collaboration with Team 426 [Zombie Apocalypse Counter Task Force](https://zactf426.com/) from the Bronx, NY. Made possible thanks to the great teamwork of [Evan Weinberg](https://evanweinberg.com/) and [Keith Violette](https://sites.google.com/view/keithviolettesprojects/home).

## Current status

For season 2020-2021, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 the FRC participation at SSIS is on hold. In the spare time in 2023 it might be possible that the software of the rover is updated to recieve PWM control inputs without a Server Host, so that it could be controlled directly by an inexpensive 6-channel Radio Control Unit like FlySky FS-i6X or [MicroZone MC6C](https://www.lazada.vn/products/tang-kem-day-deo-tx-bo-dieu-khien-6-kenh-microzone-mc6c-tx-rx-nang-cap-i1495372640-s6257032973.html?). All the while Team 426 [scored 27/41](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2022/NYLI2/rankings) in the Long Island Competition 2022 "Rapid React".

## Season 2019-2020 Infinite Recharge

In collaboration with Pinkerton Academy, Timberlane Regional High School, School for Excellence and Bronx International High School the startkit was ordered in 2019 and build early 2020. Together the [5 Schools formed Team 426](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2020/team/426). Then the collaborative programming phase began. It mainly focused on the file `Team426Robot/scr/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java`. Some [34 commits](https://github.com/emwdx/Team426Robot/commits/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) can be seen from February 29, 2020 to March 12, 2020.
